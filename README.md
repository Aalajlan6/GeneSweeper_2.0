# GeneSweeper

## About the Project

GeneSweeper, a python-based program, is a bioinformatics program that aids in the search and filter process of large RNAseq files by optimizing the pandas library and creating large data frames with desired outputs. By releasing data in a readily usable form, GeneSweeper empowers researchers to focus on their scientific discoveries rather than the intricacies of data processing.
